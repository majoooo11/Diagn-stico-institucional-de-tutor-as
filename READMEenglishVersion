# Multicampus diagnosis of the institutional tutoring model as a guarantee of the human right to higher education
## Database and Processing of University Tutoring Statistics (2015–2024)

This repository documents the process of building, cleaning, extrapolating, and projecting university tutoring data based on a database structured in MySQL and subsequently processed in Python (Google Colab).

The main objective is to obtain a consistent and complete dataset for the longitudinal analysis of tutoring at the faculty level, covering the period 2015–2024.

## General project structure

The work was carried out in two main stages:

1. Structuring and consolidation of data in MySQL  
2. Processing, extrapolation, and projection in Python  

## 1) Project context

A **relational MySQL database** was built with historical tutoring information, integrating records from **2015 to 2024**.  
The data were then exported to a `.csv` file to be processed in **Python (pandas)** within Google Colab, with the following objectives:

- To complete missing values (especially **2015**) in a reproducible manner.
- To generate and/or estimate data for **2024** using historical trends and observed rates.
- To verify internal consistency (logical rules between enrollment, graduation, and degree completion).
- To produce a final clean dataset ready for **longitudinal econometric analysis**, particularly panel data models focused on academic trajectories.

## 2. Database construction and processing

### 2.1 Structuring in MySQL

- A relational database was designed in **MySQL**, structured by:
  - Faculty
  - Year (2015–2024)
- Institutional variables were integrated, including:
  - Enrollment (first semester, third semester, and total)
  - Tutoring activities and interventions
  - Academic staff
  - Graduation and degree completion

The consolidated database ensured temporal consistency and comparability across academic units.

### 2.2 Processing and extrapolation in Python

Data processing was carried out in a **Google Colab notebook**, mainly using `pandas`, `numpy`, and visualization tools.

The main tasks performed were:

- **Initial data loading and preparation**
  - Importing the file `tutorias_facultad_2015_2024.csv`.
  - Setting data types and temporal ordering.

- **Extrapolation of missing data for 2015**
  - Filling missing values through linear extrapolation based on the 2016–2023 historical trend, applied by faculty.
  - Extrapolated variables included: tutoring interventions, number of tutors, and academic staff.

- **Generation of projected data for 2024**
  - Estimation of first-semester enrollment using trend extrapolation.
  - Calculation of third-semester enrollment using historical retention rates.
  - Projection of total enrollment while ensuring internal consistency.
  - Estimation of graduates and degree holders based on historical rates.
  - Extrapolation of other numerical variables using linear methods.

- **Adjustments and consistency checks**
  - Validation that total enrollment was greater than or equal to the sum of first- and third-semester enrollment.
  - Correction of outlier cases, including a faculty where third-semester enrollment incorrectly exceeded first-semester enrollment.
  - Graphical review of trends to detect outliers in the 2024 projections.

### 2.3 Final result

The final output is a **consolidated DataFrame (`df_extrap`)** containing:

- Observed data (2015–2023).
- Extrapolated values for 2015.
- Projected and adjusted data for 2024.

This dataset is ready for use in **descriptive statistical analysis and panel data econometric models**.

## 3. Reproducibility

This repository is designed to ensure:

- Transparency in data treatment.
- Reproducibility of results.
- Traceability between the original administrative database and the final analytical dataset.
